# Building enchant

* Install msys2
* Install base-devel ...
* Additional packages:
   * git
* Patches:
  * Fix .gitmodules to use github mirrors for gnu stuff (savannah was down :/)
   
* Run ./build-aux/appveyor-install.sh

## Questions:


Is there a list of pacman packages somewhere?
Why is there a `&&` after the creation of the readme symlink?
Why not set -e at the top of build-aux/appveyor-install ?
Why can't we use the hunspell upstream package directly ?
  (check with pacman -L)
  
Can install msys2 with chocolatey

# Packaging pyenchant

pyenchant builds enchant with:
 * some patches
 * ispell and hunspell, but not aspell - upstream only builds with hunspell
 * there's some code to put the enchant dll inside the wheel, not sure it works
 
 Ideas:
 * Write a MAKEPKG for enchant & hunspel, install them with pacman at the start of the pyenchant build!
 

Stuff in the wheel:

enchant/iconv.dll
enchant/intl.dll
enchant/libenchant-1.dll
enchant/libglib-2.0-0.dll
enchant/libgmodule-2.0-0.dll
enchant/lib/enchant/libenchant_ispell.dll
enchant/lib/enchant/libenchant_myspell.dll
enchant/share/myspell/{*.aff, *.dic}
